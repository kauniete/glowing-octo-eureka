                <h2>Commencement of studies exam</h2>
                <p>During the first week, called Content and communication, I had to create content, design and find image assets for my first website based on given art style. </p>

                <h2>User interface design</h2>
                <p>During this week I had my first go with sketching and creating paper prototypes for both mobile and desktop, creating a high-fidelity prototype, a style tile, my logo and conducting a user test (trunk test).</p>
                <p>My first logo was finally born <img class="imageone" src="assets/logo.svg" alt="logo" width="880"> </p>

                <h2>Responsive web design </h2>
                <p> For this project I had to design and build my first responsive website. It was quite a challenge to familiarize myself with the grid and media queries. The content regards Pop Art style as a continuation a previous project for our commencement of studies exam. Have a look <a class="link" href="http://indraja.dk/kea/01-web/responsive/index.html">01.04.01 Responsive website</a> </p>

                <h2>Basic Redesign-Group Project</h2>
                <p>For this project we had to redesign a really bad website. I found a good website from which we could draw inspiration. I did the user testing before and after redesigning (5sec test, trunk test), wrote a test report, and for our presentation, I summarized test results into ppt and talked about bad design principles along with "before" test results. </p>
