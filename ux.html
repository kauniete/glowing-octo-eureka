                <p> UX project lasted one month and we had to develop an innovative digital business concept for an app with an extraordinary user experience. The project was divided into the following chunks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Week 1 : Research, Ideation and Project Management</li>
                    <li>Week 2: Business Models, Users and Communication</li>
                    <li> Week 3: Design documentation and user testing</li>
                    <li> Week 4: The prototype, report feedback and final pitch</li>
                </ul>

                <p> During Week 1 we focussed on ideation and researching our ideas. Once the final decision about our service was made, we had to change it again, after I made more research regarding the topic. After a very useful feedback from our teacher, we narrowed down our service and changed the target group to Danish and international students (my idea). </p>
                <p>During Week 2 we wrote a report. For our report, I covered problem area and problem formulation, wrote analysis based on initial user testing (I took an interview from a couple of Danish students and created two surveys: one for Danish, one for international students), along with market research and SWOT analysis. </p>
                <p>During Week 3 we were working on our design documentation. I had a go with my ideas for visual identity, an app sketch and created a website prototype, but better ideas than mine won :) My task was to compile our design document based on others input and add to it/improve it where I found necessary. I improved our design brief, contributed to creation of moodboard, interviewed one user for think loud test, applied P. Mollerup's theory for trademarks.</p>
                <p> During Week 4, I prepared the pitch presentation. When presenting our persona and customer journey I added our insights from user tests to make it very realistic. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>My team was very democratic. Even though we divided our tasks, but there was room for coming up with ideas and suggestions regarding all aspects of the project. For example, especially when developing our business idea during the first week and when creating our visual identity during the third week, everyone had a go and ideas that the majority agreed upon were chosen. We were helping each other and worked for a common goal.</p>
