                <h2> Part one. 03.01.01 Tell a story without words</h2>
                <p> After a very short instruction, we had to create a video in images alone: no words could be spoken. Sound and music were allowed for atmospheric purposes, the allowed duration was up to 2 minutes and we were supposed to use our smartphones for filming. Out of three general themes, we chose "People who are too busy". For this video I came up with the story idea, a background song (from movie Nordkraft) and was the main "actress". <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sknIQsXLlqg&feature=youtu.be">See our video on YouTube</a> or below

                <h2> Part two. A promotional or informational video</h2>
                <p> For this task we had to create a video for Copenhagen Municipalityâ€™s Bicycle Program with a view to either promote or educate foreigners about cycling in Copenhagen. As part of the creation process, we had to write a treatment, explaining our video concept and a storyboard, explaining what images we need in order to tell our story. Lastly, we had to create a landing page with embedded video. </p>
                <p>During this project I came up with the idea to show biking signs in a funny way (at first I referred to a steward flight safety demonstration on a plane, which was later incorporated as part of our main character's dance in the beginning of the video). I was responsible for recording the additional sound and I coded the landing page. I took part in writing the treatment, creating the storyboard and video production. Below is our video along with links to submitted assignments.
